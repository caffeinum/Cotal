 * Composition root for the `cotal` operator CLI, published as `cotal-ai`. Importing an
 * implementation self-registers its commands into the shared registry — base mesh commands
 * plus `spawn`/`console` (@cotal-ai/cli) and the manager's control plane + daemon runners
 * (@cotal-ai/manager). The root just picks which surfaces to pull in; `runCli` resolves
 * whatever registered. A new surface (another connector, a control client …) is one more import line.
