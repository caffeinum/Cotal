// interlock, then the "Cotal" wordmark, tagline and CTA settle and HOLD. This is
// the final, silent resolve of the explainer: it does NOT fade out — it lands on
// the finished brand lockup and stays. A soft gold ripple blooms from behind the
// rings as they lock, for a subtle premium flourish.
