fix(manager): clear all Claude startup gates in the pty runtime

Claude ≥2.1.178 shows two back-to-back Enter-to-confirm gates on a fresh workspace (folder trust, then the dev-channels warning); the one-shot auto-confirm cleared only the first and hung managed agents at `starting…`. The pty runtime now presses Enter on a short timer during startup (matching the cmux runtime) instead of matching prompt text, so it clears the variable number of gates and the agent joins the mesh.
