connector-hermes: Docker-aware install, and stop leaving duplicate sidecars.

`npx @cotal-ai/connector-hermes install` now finds Hermes on its own: `hermes` on PATH (host),
else a running Hermes container (copy the plugin into the bind-mounted `HERMES_HOME` or `docker
cp`, rewrite a loopback `COTAL_SERVERS` to `host.docker.internal`, and `plugins enable` inside the
container), else `--target-home <path>` for a files-only placement. `uninstall` is symmetric and
removes only the `COTAL_*` keys it manages.

The standalone sidecar now watches the exact pid of the gateway that launched it
(`COTAL_PARENT_PID`) instead of a racy parent-pid check, so the official image's transient boot
gateway no longer leaves an orphan sidecar advertising a phantom peer. Also resolves Node from
PATH or the bundled `<HERMES_HOME>/node`, and ignores the host's extra tool-call kwargs so the
`cotal_*` tools stop erroring.
