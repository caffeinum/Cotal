Add `@cotal-ai/tmux` — tmux Runtime and TerminalLayout extension.

Each agent spawned via `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session,
with P3 `env -i` isolation. A `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux
windows from the ambient `$TMUX` session. Both self-register on import; opt in with:

```ts
import "@cotal-ai/tmux";
```

**Migration:** the built-in `tmux` manager runtime is removed — `tmux` is now resolved from the
`@cotal-ai/tmux` extension, exactly like `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`;
tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which
fails loud with a clear `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't
imported — no silent fallback to pty. To run examples under tmux, import `@cotal-ai/tmux` in the
composition root and pass `--runtime tmux` to `cotal supervise`.
