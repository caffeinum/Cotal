feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
`@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

**New**

- **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
  The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
  Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
  (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
  default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
  inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.
  - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
    and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
    manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
  - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
    running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
    (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
    (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
    exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
    are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
  - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
    never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
    whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
    the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
    and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
    that created the run.
  - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
    (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
    no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

  Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
  generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
  `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

- **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
  `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
  isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
  ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
  `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

- **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
  broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

**Architecture**

- **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
  `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
  extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
  resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
  `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
  `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
  (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

  **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
  `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
  now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
  typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
  `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
  rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
  union.

- **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
  same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
  silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
  mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
  override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
  used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

**Fixes & hardening**

- **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
  actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
- **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
  longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
- **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
  stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
  `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
- **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
  are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
- **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
  tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
- **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
  / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

**Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
`cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
`"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
pty.
