 * `cotal spawn` hands the terminal straight to the agent: run it in your shell,
 * or inside a cmux/tmux pane, and the real Claude TUI takes over.
 *
 * The launch recipe is the connector's `buildLaunch` (the single source of truth,
 * shared with the manager); only *how the spec runs* differs — foreground exec
 * here vs. a supervised runtime in the manager. The connector is resolved from
 * the registry by agent type, composed at the root.
 *
 * The mesh it joins — creds and personas together — is resolved by {@link resolveMeshTarget}, so a
 * bare `cotal spawn <persona>` from any directory finds the running mesh (one up, or the `current`
 * default) instead of mistaking `~/.cotal` for a space.
