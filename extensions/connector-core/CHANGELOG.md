### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- a10ed79: OpenCode connector: mirror each agent's session transcript to its per-agent `tr-<name>` channel, event-driven from the plugin's in-process bus events (`message.updated` / `message.part.updated` / `session.idle`) — parity with the Claude connector, with no per-turn session refetch. The `tr-<name>` channel convention is exposed through the `Connector` contract (`Connector.transcriptChannel`) so the manager can grant the agent's publish ACL without the channel literal living in `@cotal-ai/core`, and the manager forwards control-plane `capabilities` (`COTAL_CAPABILITIES`) so a manifest-spawned agent exposes the `cotal_spawn` / `cotal_persona` tools its creds already authorize. Adds an end-to-end smoke for the mirror (`smoke:opencode-transcript`).

## 0.8.2

## 0.8.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 878f406: Persona ownership, env allow-list, MCP sharing, and the reconnect tool

  - **`definePersona` content/policy split** with a write-once persistent file owner: a peer can't
    grant itself a capability or seize ownership of a persona file, and a persona-only edit can't
    silently clear an existing model. `role` is spawn-time policy and has been removed from the
    `cotal_persona` tool surface (advertising it was a silent no-op).
  - **Spawned-child env allow-list** (`launch.ts`): runtimes receive only the declared env, never
    `process.env`, with per-connector model-key forwarding.
  - **Opt-in per-connector MCP server sharing** for spawned agents.
  - **`cotal_reconnect`** tool added to the shared tool surface (renders on both Claude Code and
    OpenCode) for manual mesh recovery. `cotal_purge` is dropped from the agent tool surface — it
    is admin-only now, so the operator path is `cotal history clear`.
  - Agent transcript mirroring is now opt-in (default off); a spawn permission denial names the
    missing capability instead of blaming the manager.

## 0.3.2

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.
- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 246c9b9: Add the `cotal_feedback` beta egress: a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` config plus `feedbackLine()` guidance folded into the Claude/Codex connector instructions, and a `cotal feedback` authenticated intake server (tester keys, JSONL source of truth, republish to an internal `#feedback` channel). Note: the agent-side `cotal_feedback` tool registration is still pending.
- 246c9b9: Add the OpenCode connector. It launches a watchable `opencode` TUI bound to the agent's session — a headless `opencode serve` with the mesh plugin loaded, plus a foreground `opencode attach --session <id>` — drives that visible session via `session.promptAsync`, and renders the `cotal_*` tools as native plugin tools at Claude-Code parity. The tool surface is extracted into `cotalToolSpecs` in connector-core so the Claude/Codex MCP adapters and the OpenCode plugin render the same tools.
