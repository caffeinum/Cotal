/**
 * The spawned-agent env allow-list (P3) — the single chokepoint for what a child process sees.
 *
 * Connectors build the child's env as `{ ...launchEnv(...), <COTAL_* identity>, <connector vars> }`
 * and the runtimes pass ONLY that (never `...process.env`). So the operator's *unrelated* env
 * (AWS creds, GH tokens, other service keys sitting in their shell) stops bleeding into every
 * spawned child. What a child sees is auditable from the spec, not "whatever the manager
 * inherited."
 *
 * Scope this is HONEST about (P6): it closes ENV-VAR bleed. It does NOT close (i) model-key
 * exfil for key-based providers — the agent holds the key in its own process to do inference, so
 * a compromised agent exfils from its OWN env, spawn-gating the key only breaks the child's LLM
 * function (the real fix is per-agent model auth, a separate roadmap item); nor (ii) filesystem
 * secret access — HOME / XDG / platform config dirs are forwarded, so a child can still read
 * ~/.aws / ~/.ssh / ~/.config off disk (needs a workspace sandbox, a separate control).
