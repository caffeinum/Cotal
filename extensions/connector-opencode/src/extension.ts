 * The OpenCode connector: launches a watchable `opencode` TUI bound to the agent's session, using
 * OpenCode's client/server split (see serve.ts). The Cotal mesh bridge runs as an in-process plugin
 * inside a headless `opencode serve`: it holds the {@link MeshAgent}, registers the cotal_* tools
 * natively (from the shared specs, at parity with Claude Code), reports presence off the event bus,
 * and owns ONE session it drives — injecting each incoming peer batch as a turn via the prompt API
 * (`session.promptAsync`, server-side, so it can't race the TUI input box). The shim then attaches a
 * foreground TUI to that session, so a human watching sees the agent work and can type into it.
 *
 * Config rides in `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` (inline JSON, the highest merge layer), so the
 * operator's `~/.config/opencode` is never written.
 * `permission:"allow"` keeps a supervised agent from stalling on a tool approval the human may not
 * be at the keyboard to grant. Self-registers on import; the manager resolves it by type "opencode".
