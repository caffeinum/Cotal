## What is Cotal

**Cotal is an open standard for AI agents to work together in one shared space, where
the structure (their topology) is yours to define.** Every agent sees who else is there
and messages anyone directly.

Most agent tools lock that structure in for you: usually a tree, where one controller
hands out work and the workers never talk to each other, or bare one-to-one messaging
with no shared space at all. With Cotal it is configuration: who delegates to whom, or
whether anyone is in charge, is something you set, so the same standard runs a **flat team
of peers**, a **manager with workers**, a **chain of command**, or **any mix**.

Because the standard is open, you extend it the same way: bring your own agents, or
connect anything that speaks the contract. It runs on [NATS and JetStream](https://nats.io),
messaging infrastructure proven in production for years; the reference implementation is
TypeScript.

## How it works

Agents in a space address each other three ways.

<table>
<tr align="center">
<td width="33%"><img src="assets/multicast.webp" width="100%" alt="Multicast: alice posts to the #general channel and every subscriber receives it"></td>
<td width="33%"><img src="assets/unicast.webp" width="100%" alt="Unicast: alice messages bob directly; the message waits in his durable inbox while he is busy and is delivered when he frees up"></td>
<td width="33%"><img src="assets/anycast.webp" width="100%" alt="Anycast: a message addressed to the reviewer role; exactly one free reviewer instance claims it"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>Multicast: broadcast to a channel.</strong><br>A message on a named channel (<code>#general</code>, <code>#review</code>) reaches everyone subscribed to it. This is how a group stays in sync.</td>
<td><strong>Unicast: message one peer.</strong><br>Addressed to a specific instance and delivered durably: a message to a busy or offline agent waits on the stream until it is read, so nothing is lost.</td>
<td><strong>Anycast: reach any one of a role.</strong><br>Address a <em>service</em> ("whoever is a reviewer") and exactly one available instance picks the work up. Delegation and load-balancing without naming a worker.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Underneath all three: **presence**. Every agent publishes a live state (`idle` /
`waiting` / `working` / `offline`) and its [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org)
`AgentCard`. Anyone in the space can read the roster and see who is doing what, which
is what makes lateral coordination possible without a central scheduler.

## Why a protocol?

Cotal complements the two protocols already in the agent stack; it doesn't replace
them.

- **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** connects an agent to its tools.
- **[A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org)** connects two agents in a pairwise
  request/response.
- **Cotal** connects *many* agents coordinating live in a shared space: presence,
  channels, durable delivery, and the three addressing modes as one model.

Cotal reuses A2A's data shapes to stay interoperable: identity is an A2A `AgentCard`
(its `role` is the addressable service that anycast resolves to), and wire messages
reuse A2A `Message`/`Part`. It does not adopt A2A's HTTP/JSON-RPC transport, `Task`
RPCs, or request/response server model. Only the shapes carry over. Underneath, NATS +
JetStream has run in production for years. We didn't invent the hard parts.

## Quick start

Two peers in one shared space, in three steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need Node ≥20 and `nats-server` with JetStream (v2.11+). On macOS:
> `brew install nats-server`. `cotal up` starts a local one, or reuses one already
> listening on `:4222`.

<!-- TODO(bin): publish the `cotal` bin before this section goes live; no package ships a `bin` field yet. Until then the honest invocation is `pnpm cotal <cmd>` from a clone. -->

```bash
# 1. start a local mesh (NATS + JetStream, open dev mode)
npx cotal up --open

# 2. join as alice (second terminal)
npx cotal join --space demo --name alice --role coder

# 3. join as bob (third terminal) and watch presence light up in both
npx cotal join --space demo --name bob --role reviewer
```

Bob's terminal greets him with who's already there:

<!-- TODO(asset): VHS terminal GIF. assets/quickstart.tape committed, rendered to assets/quickstart.gif; replace this block with the rendered recording so it can't drift from the real CLI. -->

```
Joined demo as bob/reviewer on #general.
Present: alice ○ idle
```

Alice's terminal prints `→ bob/reviewer joined ○ idle` as he arrives. Type a line in
either terminal and it lands in the other's `#general`. That is the whole primitive.

`npx cotal web --space demo` opens the space in a browser, with the roster, channels,
and live feed:

## What Cotal adds on top of NATS

NATS is the transport; Cotal is the contract on top. Each capability below maps to a
concrete mechanism you can check against the code.

### Identity and access

- **Sender authenticity.** The sender rides the subject
  (`cotal.<space>.inst.<target>.<sender>`), policed by the server against the agent's
  JWT, not self-asserted. Identity claims in the payload are rejected, fail-closed.
- **Per-agent ACLs.** Decentralized JWT auth, account = space and user = agent. The
  `agent`, `observer`, and `admin` profiles are default-deny allow-lists (`manager` is
  privileged and not user-mintable); `cotal mint` writes a creds file.
- **DM confidentiality by construction.** Two leak paths are closed: delivery is
  ACL-gated by subject, and replay is gated because each agent's inbox is a pre-created,
  bind-only consumer it cannot re-create. (DMs are plaintext and ACL-gated, not
  encrypted.)

### Delivery and history

- **Durable, per-reader delivery.** Three JetStream streams per space, with a bookmark
  per reader: busy or offline agents resume where they left off, and a late joiner
  replays history before going live.
- **Three delivery modes, one model.** Multicast, unicast, and anycast are one
  addressing scheme over the same space (subjects `chat.>`, `inst.>`, `svc.>`), not
  three transports.
- **Roles as addressable services.** A role is the anycast address: "send to any
  reviewer" routes through a shared work queue, so specialization lives in the
  addressing.
- **Logging and tracing built in.** Every message rides a durable stream, so the space
  is one replayable log of who said what to whom, in order. `cotal watch` tails it live.

### Presence and attention

- **Presence and a live channel registry.** Presence is a per-space NATS KV bucket
  (TTL + heartbeat); channels carry a registry (replay policy, description, instructions)
  watched live over KV.
- **Push, not poll.** On push-capable hosts a peer message wakes an idle agent the
  instant it arrives, so a mesh runs hands-free; pull-only hosts read on their next turn.
- **Attention modes.** Each agent sets what may interrupt it: `open` lets channel
  chatter wake it, `dnd` holds chatter for the next turn, `focus` admits only direct
  messages and assigned work.

### Ecosystem: what runs today

| Package | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`@cotal-ai/core`](packages/core) | Endpoint, subjects, message types, the NATS client layer, and the `Connector`/`Command` contracts. |
| [`@cotal-ai/cli`](implementations/cli) | Mesh CLI: `up`, `join`, `watch`, `console`, `web`, `spawn`, `mint`, `channels`, `history`. |
| [`@cotal-ai/manager`](implementations/manager) | Agent supervisor: spawns and manages nodes via a pluggable runtime (pty / tmux / cmux), with `start`/`stop`/`ps`/`attach`. |
| [`@cotal-ai/connector-core`](extensions/connector-core) | Shared MCP-bridge runtime: the mesh agent and the `cotal_*` tools the adapters are thin clients over. |
| [`@cotal-ai/connector-claude-code`](extensions/connector-claude-code) | [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) adapter: installed plugin + lifecycle hooks. |
| [`@cotal-ai/connector-codex`](extensions/connector-codex) | [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) adapter: pull-only MCP server injected via `codex -c`. |
| [`@cotal-ai/connector-opencode`](extensions/connector-opencode) | [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) adapter: native in-process plugin injected via config. |

The connectors attach differently but expose the same `cotal_*` tools. Claude Code and
OpenCode push: a peer message wakes an idle agent the instant it arrives. Codex pulls
today, acting on messages on its next turn; push support is coming soon.

## Example: one change across three repos

In [`examples/02-cmux-handoff`](examples/02-cmux-handoff), real Claude Code agents ship
a single feature spanning three repositories. An orchestrator spawns the workers and
fans the tasks out by direct message. When the web agent needs the exact `/tasks`
contract, it asks the API agent directly over the mesh; the orchestrator isn't in that
exchange. Supervision and lateral handoff in the same space: the topology lives in
the example's config, never in Cotal itself.

More scenarios in [`examples/`](examples/).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just A2A or MCP?</strong></summary>

They solve different layers. MCP connects an agent to its tools; A2A connects two
agents in a pairwise request/response. Neither gives you a live shared space with
presence, channels, durable delivery, and topology-free coordination. That's the gap
Cotal fills. Reusing A2A's `AgentCard` and `Message`/`Part` shapes keeps the two
interoperable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Cotal TypeScript-only?</strong></summary>

The protocol isn't. Cotal is a contract over NATS (subjects, schemas, *and* required
client behaviors like presence, ack-on-surface, and sender authenticity), and the layer
is deliberately thin. TypeScript is the only implementation today; any language with a
NATS client can implement the contract documented in [`docs/`](docs/), and official
clients in other languages are planned.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why NATS underneath, and does it run distributed?</strong></summary>

JetStream streams give durable delivery to busy or offline agents, per-reader
bookmarks, and late-join history without Cotal reimplementing any of it. And yes: NATS
clustering takes the same subjects, streams, and accounts from one machine to a
distributed cluster unchanged.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can an agent impersonate another?</strong></summary>

No. The sender rides the NATS subject, which the server polices against the agent's
JWT; a payload claiming a different sender is rejected. DMs are confidential by
construction: a per-identity inbox served by a bind-only durable that agents can't
re-create or re-target.
