/**
 * Self-serve channel-join smoke (SPEC v0.3 overlay). Two phases:
 *
 *  Phase 1 — NO delivery daemon serving Plane-3: an auth-mode agent joins a channel's live feed at
 *  runtime and receives the live message via its native core subscription (broker-enforced by sub.allow).
 *  Join reports `durable:false` (joined live, backstop unestablished — no daemon); out-of-ACL join is
 *  refused (broker-confirmed); a core-sub leave stops delivery; the live read survives a broker
 *  reconnect. Daemon-free, so there is no durable backstop to establish or tombstone.
 *
 *  Phase 2 — a real Plane-3 host is present (the server-side delivery daemon: fan-out + trusted reader +
 *  the durableJoin/durableLeave/listMemberships ops it serves on `ctl.delivery`). A runtime join now also
 *  arms a Plane-3 backstop (`durable:true`), delivered alongside the live core-sub copy (the connector's
 *  id-dedup coalesces to exactly once — proven in cross-path-dedup). A runtime leave tombstones the §7
 *  boundary. And a BOOT durable membership — established by the agent's SELF-JOIN at connect (v3, not
 *  written at provision) — seeds the agent's leave mirror, so leaving the boot channel tombstones it too.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:self-serve-join:auth   (needs `nats-server` on PATH; auth/JetStream, local-only)
