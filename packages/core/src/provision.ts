/**
 * The provisioner — the signer capability for a space.
 *
 * A space is one NATS *account*; every agent is a *user* in it. This module mints the
 * decentralized-JWT trust chain (operator → account → user) programmatically with
 * `@nats-io/jwt`, so there is no dependency on the external `nsc` CLI and the signing
 * key stays in one place (whoever holds {@link SpaceAuth.account.signingSeed}).
 *
 * Demo-1 stage: out-of-band mint. `cotal up` creates the space's trust material
 * once and writes a `nats-server` config (operator + system account + MEMORY resolver);
 * `cotal mint` and the manager load that material and mint per-agent creds files. There
 * is no connect-time token exchange yet (that's the later auth-callout stage).
 *
 * NOT yet provided (our job, not nsc's): credential revocation and an issuance audit
 * trail. Revocation is deferred past Demo 1; minted creds currently have no TTL.

 *  fan-out writer + trusted reader + activation catch-up + membership/ACL reads + members-KV writes +
 *  the lease + the `ctl.delivery` control service touch. `sub.allow` is the per-identity inbox (all JS
 *  pull delivery / KV-watch / request replies land there) PLUS the `ctl.delivery` control subtree it
 *  serves; ALL stream/KV reads ride the JS API (publishes), so there is NO native `chat`/`dinbox`/`dlv`
 *  subscription — a leaked cred can't natively sniff the mixed pre-auth store. Honest blast radius
 *  (delivery-daemon.md): it can write any owner's `dlv` (the post-auth store agents trust); the future
 *  fan-out/reader cred split bounds that. */
