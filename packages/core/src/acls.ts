 * Durable read-ACL registry — read/write helpers over the per-space ACL KV bucket
 * (`cotal_acl_<space>`). One {@link AclRecord} per OWNER under {@link aclKey}, holding that owner's
 * current read ACL (`allowSubscribe`). This is the **keystone** that lets the Plane-3 trusted reader
 * run in a stateless, server-side **delivery daemon**: the reader re-authorizes every durable entry
 * against the owner's ACL read FRESH from here (not the manager's in-memory ledger), so a daemon
 * restart re-reads the truth instead of nak-looping every unknown owner to `term()`.
 *
 * Writes are **privileged** — the manager records an agent's ACL at mint time (the same act as baking
 * it into the JWT); agent-authored ACLs are forbidden (they would self-authorize reads). Every write
 * is a single ATOMIC CAS put of the whole value, so a present record is always complete: a present
 * `allowSubscribe: []` is a known "reads nothing" policy (the reader DROPS), distinct from an ABSENT
 * record (a genuinely-unknown owner — the reader DEFERS, never drops).
