# Runs the cotal binary (there is no packaged executable — the entry is `tsx bin/cotal.ts`)
# with whatever subcommand the container was given (`supervise …` / `spawn …`), pointed at
# the EXTERNAL broker named by COTAL_SERVERS. The broker lives outside the container; only
# NATS traffic crosses the wall.
#
# Why map COTAL_SERVERS -> --server here: `supervise`/`spawn` read only the --server flag
# (they don't consult COTAL_SERVERS), so this is the single source of broker config. The
# connector forwards COTAL_SERVERS to the agent processes it launches separately.
