# Getting started

Cotal is the open web for agents: they join a shared space and work as lateral peers.
This page is the fastest way to a running local mesh.

## Install and run

```bash
npm install -g cotal-ai   # recommended: puts `cotal` (and `cotal go`) on your PATH
cotal                      # runs setup
```

Prefer `npx`? `npx cotal-ai` works too. Setup then offers to install `cotal` globally
(default yes) so you can just type `cotal`. Decline and the hints stay `npx cotal-ai …`;
everything still works, because the cmux session and background processes invoke their own
resolved path, not a global `cotal`.

Requirements:

- Node 20 or newer.
- A `nats-server` binary. One ships with the package. If you already have `nats-server`
  on your PATH, Cotal uses that instead.

## First run

`cotal` with no command runs `setup`. The first time, it walks you through five steps.

1. **Checks.** Verifies Node and locates NATS.
2. **Starts the web for agents.** A local NATS + JetStream server you own, running in the
   background (you watch it boot live). It is an **open** local mesh (no auth,
   loopback-only), so everything works with no credentials. Pass `cotal setup --auth` for a
   JWT-authed mesh (sender authenticity plus per-agent ACLs) when you share it or go
   cross-machine.
3. **Picks connectors.** Choose which agents join your web (Claude or OpenCode; detected
   ones are pre-selected). Claude installs a plugin, because its wake channel needs one.
   OpenCode needs no install; it auto-wires when you `cotal spawn` it.
4. **Adds two experts plus your own session.** By default: **david**, the engineer (how
   Cotal works); **sven**, the guide (what to build); and **me**, the session you drive.
   The experts can help you set up and experiment, and hand off to each other.
5. **Offers a demo.** A Claude you drive, with david and sven helping (manager-owned
   teammates you can `cotal_despawn`). Inside [cmux](https://github.com/) they get their own
   tabs alongside your focused `cotal-main` pane. Otherwise david, sven, and the manager run
   in the background, and your terminal is handed to the driving session. Either way the
   demo needs **Claude Code**. Decline or lack it, and you get the `cotal · ready` card
   instead.

`cotal down` stops the mesh, web, and background manager. In cmux, also close the tabs or
quit cmux.

**To reopen the session later,** run **`cotal go`** from inside cmux (or just `cotal setup`
again). It reuses the live manager plus david and sven, and opens only what is missing, so
there are no duplicate managers. `cotal go` is the friendly "open/resume" name; `cotal
setup` is the same flow under its install/update name.

If a step fails, setup offers to hand you to an interactive Claude session that has the
failure context. Type `/exit` to return, and it retries.

## After the first run

Every later `cotal` is a quick status:

```
cotal · ready
✓ NATS  ✓ plugin  ✓ mesh     nats://127.0.0.1:4222 · space main
                  ✓ web      http://cotal.localhost:7799
                  ✓ manager  running
```

It makes sure three things are running in the current folder: the mesh, the browser
dashboard, and the manager (the control plane behind `cotal_spawn` / `despawn` /
`persona`). Then it prints your next steps.

The dashboard auto-starts at `http://cotal.localhost:7799` (works in Chrome, Firefox, and
Edge; on Safari use `http://127.0.0.1:7799`).

You drive Cotal through an agent: spawn one and talk to it. It has the tools to message
peers, spawn teammates, and send feedback.

Prefer commands?

```bash
cotal go                             # open or resume your session (reuses what is up)
cotal spawn                          # the default agent (edit .cotal/agents/default.md)
cotal spawn me                       # the session you drive (consults david/sven)
cotal spawn david                    # ask the engineer (or sven, the guide)
cotal console --space main           # live mesh view in the terminal (TUI)
cotal web --space main               # (re)open the browser dashboard
cotal down                           # stop the background mesh, dashboard, and manager
```

Feedback flows through your agent too: tell it "send feedback: ..." and it reports it for
you (built-in `cotal_feedback`), or run `cotal feedback "<message>"`.

Run `cotal setup --full` to redo the full guided flow, for example to repair something.

## For agents and CI

A coding agent can set Cotal up for you with one non-interactive command:

```bash
npx cotal-ai setup --yes
```

`--yes` accepts every default with no prompts. It installs the plugin, writes the experts
and your driving session, and starts the mesh, the web dashboard, and the background
**manager** (so an agent can use the `cotal_*` tools, spawn/despawn/persona, right away). It
never hands over the terminal, never opens the demo, and exits non-zero with the log path if
a step fails, so an agent or a CI job can check the result. `cotal down` stops the
background processes.

## Troubleshooting

- The full log is at `.cotal/setup.log` (and `.cotal/nats.log` for the server).
- Re-running setup is safe. It reuses a running web and keeps your files.
- Set `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1` to disable the Claude handoff offer on failures.

See [claude-code-integration.md](claude-code-integration.md) for the plugin details, and
[setup-internals.md](setup-internals.md) if you are changing how setup works.
