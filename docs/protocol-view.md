# Protocol view: one model, many surfaces

A "protocol view" is a **read-only observer** over a space: a `CotalEndpoint` with
`consume:false, registerPresence:false, watchPresence:true`, invisible to peers. Everything
below is derived from that one observer. No surface opens its own NATS connection, and none
re-implements the wire semantics. The wire is the source of truth; these are renderings of it.

## Surfaces

| surface | command | intent | stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| **console** | `cotal console` | interactive terminal: drive it, drill in | Ink / React (TTY) |
| **stream** | `cotal console --plain`, pipes | passive line log: tail it, grep it, CI | plain ANSI |
| **web** | `cotal web` | operator dashboard: see what needs you | HTTP + SSE, vanilla JS |

`console` auto-selects: a real TTY gets the Ink TUI, a pipe or `--plain` gets the stream.
`watch` is an alias of `console --plain`. The web dashboard is a **god-view** (it self-mints an
admin cred so it sees DMs and anycast); the terminal console sees what its creds allow
(`dmVisible`).

**Admin overview.** `cotal console` with **no `--space`** on an open mesh opens a space picker
first: every space on the server (enumerated from its `CHAT_*` streams plus presence buckets via
`listSpaces()`) with agents, channels, and message counts. Pick one to drop into its console;
`b` returns to the overview. `--space X` skips the picker. Under auth a server hosts a single
space, so the console enters it directly (no overview).

**Generate traffic to test them:** `cotal demo --space demo` spins up a handful of mock agents
that loop a scripted trace hitting every message type (multicast across channels plus mentions,
peer DMs, a coalesced burst, an unclaimed anycast) and every presence state. Run it next to
`cotal console` / `cotal web`.

## The shared model: `MeshView` (`@cotal-ai/cli`)

One class consumes the observer and emits a normalized, render-agnostic model: no ANSI, no
React, no HTML, no color palette, pure data. It owns the endpoint lifecycle (`start → tap →
stop`) and batches every source (roster events, the tap, burst flushes, channel polls, the
rate/age heartbeat) into one snapshot per tick.

```ts
new MeshView(ep, { window?, tapSubject? })
  .on("entry",  (e: FeedEntry) => …)   // one classified+coalesced row, as it lands (stream)
  .on("change", (s: MeshSnapshot) => …) // batched snapshot (~75ms) for dashboards
  await view.start(); …; await view.stop();

interface MeshSnapshot {
  agents:    Presence[];   // card.kind === "agent", sorted working→waiting→idle→offline, then name
  endpoints: Presence[];   // everything else
  channels:  { channel: string; messages: number }[];
  feed:      FeedEntry[];  // classified + coalesced + windowed
  rates:     { msgsPerSec: number };
  status:    { connected: boolean; space: string; dmVisible: boolean; error?: string };
  signals:   MeshSignals;  // derived operator signals (below)
  nameOf:    (id: string) => string;   // unicast target id → display name
}

interface FeedEntry {           // one feed row
  id; ts; from: EndpointRef;
  delivery: "multicast" | "unicast" | "anycast";
  channel?; toService?;         // multicast / anycast target
  toNames?: string[]; count?;   // unicast: resolved targets + burst multiplicity
  text: string;                 // parts joined, no ANSI
}
```

**What the model already does** (today, split across `render.ts` plus `console/mesh.ts` plus
`web/app.js`; Phase A folds it into one place):

- **Classification:** `deliveryOf(subject)` returns chat / unicast / anycast (the view renders
  `chat` as multicast); `null` (control, presence, trace) drops out of the feed.
- **Coalescing:** same-sender/same-text unicast bursts within 400 ms collapse to one entry
  (deterministic `id` = first message, `ts` = earliest, `count` = multiplicity).
- **Roster:** a status-sorted snapshot plus a `byId` map for id→name; agents split from
  endpoints.
- **History prefill:** a one-shot per-channel backlog (multicast only, since `dmHistory` needs
  admin), deduped against the live tap by `id`.
- **Windowing:** the feed is capped (~300), with a rolling `msgs/s` rate.

### Derived operator signals

The web dashboard already computes these client-side (`dmPeers`, `waitingCards`, the tile
counts). They move into the model so the TUI gets them for free too.

```ts
interface MeshSignals {
  counts:  { working; waiting; idle; offline };   // golden-signal tiles
  waiting: Presence[];                            // agents blocked / needing input, oldest-first
  oldestWaitingTs?: number;                       // "oldest unattended"
  dms:     DmPeer[];                              // per-peer DM roll-up → threads (god-view only)
}
```

`dms` is populated only when DMs are visible (god-view / open mode); it groups unicast traffic
into per-peer conversations, only pairs that actually talked, never the n² cross-product.

## Feature to surface map

| feature | model field | console (Ink) | stream | web |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| roster (status, activity, age) | `agents` / `endpoints` | ✓ panel | ✓ presence lines | ✓ sidebar |
| all-activity feed | `feed` | ✓ feed panel | ✓ log | ✓ Monitor view |
| channels plus counts | `channels` | ✓ tabs (1–9) |  | ✓ sidebar + Channel view |
| golden-signal counts | `signals.counts` | ✓ tiles strip |  | ✓ tiles |
| needs-you / blocked | `signals.waiting` | ✓ rail (`n`) |  | ✓ NEEDS-YOU rail |
| direct-message lens | `signals.dms` | ✓ lens (`d`) |  | ✓ DM view |
| topology lens (who-talks-to-whom) | `feed` + `agents` (derived) | ✓ lens (`t`, 3 variants) |  |  |
| message / agent **detail** | `feed` / `agents` | ✓ select → detail |  | ✓ row / thread |
| **search / filter** | client | ✓ `/` | (grep) | ✓ mode chips |
| msgs/s, connected, dmVisible | `rates` / `status` | ✓ status bar |  | ✓ conn pill |

Both interactive surfaces now render every model field. The console adds the signals as a
one-row tiles strip (always on), a NEEDS-YOU rail toggled with `n` (a side column when the
terminal is wide, else a full-screen overlay), and a DM lens toggled with `d` (peer roll-up plus
thread; shows "DMs hidden" under chat-only creds). The stream is line-oriented, so the signals
stay out of it. The topology lens (`t`) folds the feed plus roster into a who-talks-to-whom graph
client-side and renders it three switchable ways (`v` / `1-3`): swimlane sequence, adjacency
heat matrix, and a ring node-link map with channels/roles as hub nodes.

## Future: not yet on the wire

The web's `?demo` scene also mocks features that **no protocol message backs yet**. They render
only as the static Penpot reference, never from live data, and are deliberately *not* implemented
on either live surface. They live here as design intent until the wire grows to support them:

| flourish | what it would need |
|---|---|
| intent badges ("about to act") | a new intent message kind / field on the wire |
| approval requests (approve / deny) | a request message kind plus a response path (interactive) |
| task-failed alerts | a failure signal: a manager lifecycle event or a presence status |
| unclaimed-anycast / status roll-up | mostly derivable from existing traffic; a `MeshView` signal |
| per-conversation unread | per-viewer client state, not really protocol |

## Principles

- **Derive once, render many.** Classification, coalescing, sorting, id→name, rate, windowing,
  and the operator signals live in `MeshView`. A surface only *lays out* the model; it never
  re-derives it. New surfaces are thin clients.
- **Presentation stays per-surface.** Color palette (`agentColor`), layout, CSS, keybindings,
  and input handling belong to each renderer, not the model.
- **No fallbacks.** If the observer cannot do what a surface needs, throw; do not silently
  degrade.
- **Status is shape *and* color.** `● working · ◐ waiting · ○ idle · ⨯/⊘ offline`, never color
  alone (accessibility).
