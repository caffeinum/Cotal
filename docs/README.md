# Cotal docs

These describe the **protocol**, the wire contract that *is* Cotal. Each runnable example
documents itself in its own `examples/*/README.md`. Working build-plans and research live
in the private `.internal/` submodule, not here.

## New here? Read these three, in order

1. **[OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md)** answers *what Cotal is* and what it can do.
2. **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** answers *how it is built*: the A2A/SLIM
   influences, the package tiers, the manager, and the NATS/JetStream mapping.
3. **[claude-code-integration.md](claude-code-integration.md)** answers *how a coding
   agent joins*: the plugin, hooks, MCP `cotal_*` tools, and agent files.

To install and run a local mesh first, start with
**[getting-started.md](getting-started.md)**.
